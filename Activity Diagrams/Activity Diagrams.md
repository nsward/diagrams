## What is an Activity Diagram?
These are the rules we apply to these diagrams:

An Activity Diagramâ€¦
* includes Actions taken by all stakeholders (users AND systems)
* includes decisions made by all stakeholders (users AND systems)
* includes all possible paths
* has (at least) 1 path defined as the Optimal/MVP/Happy-path
* has labels IN or OUT of scope for DIF pilots on all paths
* has only 1 start-point and 1 end-point (regardless of end-state)
