## What is an Activity Diagram?
These are the rules we apply to these diagrams:

An Activity Diagramâ€¦
* includes Actions taken by *all* stakeholders (PA/AW/HO and systems)
* includes Decisions made by *all* stakeholders (PA/AW/HO and systems)
* includes all possible paths
* has (at least) 1 path defined as the Optimal/MVP/Happy-path
* has labels OUT of scope for DIF pilots on all paths
