## What is an Activity Diagram?
These are the rules we apply to these diagrams:

An Activity Diagramâ€¦
* includes Actions taken by *all* stakeholders (PA/AW/HO and systems)
* includes Decisions made by *all* stakeholders (PA/AW/HO and systems)
* includes all possible paths (Including far-future ideas or to-be-discussed features)
* has (at least) 1 path defined as the Optimal/MVP/Happy-path
* has indicators/labels for "OUT of scope for DIF" on all relevant paths
