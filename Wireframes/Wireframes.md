Wireframes
==========

## Interfaces of the 121-platform:
- PA-App - Mobile app for People Affected
- AW-App - Mobile app for Aid-Workers
- [HO-Portal](./HO-Portal--Wireframes--v1.xd) - Web app for Humanitarian Organisations


## What is a wireframe?
There are a lot of possible definitions for 'wireframe'; But we use the following rules:

- It shows all interactive elements of an interface
- It shows the structure of the content of a screen and the interactive elements
- It shows a *realistic* version of possible data/content (So no "Lorum ipsum"-text)
- It shows (where possible/useful) multiple versions of possible data/content to show minimum/maximum use-cases
- It **doesn't** depict a pixel-perfect preview of the final product
- It **doesn't** depict a fully consistent 'click-through demo' of the final product


## Working on a wireframe
We use [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) to create the wireframes.
The application is free and might require an (also free) Adobe-account.

The files contain a sub-set of elements from the [Material Design-system](https://material.io/) to easily copy and paste from.
